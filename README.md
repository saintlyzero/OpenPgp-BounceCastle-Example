OpenPgp-BounceCastle-Example
============================

This is an OpenPgp + BounceCastle, Java Example, for education. Check the 3 test methods inside the class org.jdamico.bc.openpgp.tests.TestBCOpenPGP:

* genKeyPair()
* encrypt()
* decrypt()
------
Libraries required
===========================
1) BouncyCastle Libraries 

  a) bcprov-jdk15on-150.jar 
  
  b) bcpg-jdk15on-150.jar 
  
2) Java Cryptography Extension (JCE)

  a. local_policy.jar 
  
  b. US_export_policy.jar 
  
Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy Files are required, since PGP requires strong Keys which cannot be generated by JRE without these external libraries.
JCE for Java 8 : http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jce8-download-2133166.html
